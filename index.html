    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>
      Hello, my name is <strong>Julie Ann M. Toledo</strong>, but you can call me <em>Julie</em> for short. <br>
      I‚Äôm from <strong>Munting Tubig, Ibaan, Batangas</strong> and I‚Äôm 20 years old. My birthday is <time datetime="2005-03-01">March 1, 2005</time>, and I am currently pursuing a degree in <strong>Information Technology</strong> at <em>Batangas State University</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      My mother‚Äôs name is <strong>Marilou</strong>, and my father‚Äôs name is <strong>Bonifacio</strong>. I am an only child, but I have a playful orange cat named <mark>Miming</mark>. He is half Persian and loves eating his favorite treats. He has become a big part of my daily life.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my free time, I enjoy watching anime and K-dramas. I also love eating <strong>sinigang</strong>, which is my favorite Filipino dish. Most of the time, I work at <strong>McDonald‚Äôs</strong>, where I handle customer orders and assist in maintaining service quality. Being a working student is challenging, but it has taught me a lot about patience, time management, and responsibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      My dream is to become successful in life ‚Äî not just in my career, but also as a person who continues to grow, inspire others, and make a difference.
    </p>
